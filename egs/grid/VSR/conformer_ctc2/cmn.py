"""Cepstral mean normalisation for AV-HuBERT features.

Kaldi's ``apply-cmvn`` (mean only, which is its default) subtracts a mean from
every feature dimension before the acoustic model sees it. The ssl-kaldi GRID
recipe does this per speaker; a live demo has no speaker labels and one clip
per visitor, so the equivalent here is per utterance.

Why it matters: measured on layer-4 mean-face features, the GRID -> Lombard
domain shift is almost entirely a mean offset -- the mean moves by 73.8 in
feature space, three times the typical within-GRID per-utterance deviation
(24.4), while per-dimension standard deviations are unchanged (median ratio
0.99). Subtracting the per-utterance mean removes that offset, so variance
normalisation is not needed and is deliberately not done.

The same mode must be used for training, decoding and the demo: a model
trained on normalised features decodes unnormalised ones poorly, and the
mismatch is silent.
